"Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love,  every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every superstar, every supreme leader,  every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam" - Carl Sagan:

"You're always free to change your mind and choose a different future, or a different past." - Donald Shimoda:
"'You don't do anything. Cosmic Law, remember? Like attracts like. Just be who you are, calm and clear and bright. Automatically, as we shine who we are, asking ourselves every minute is this what I really want to do, doing it only when we answer yes, automatically that turns away those who have nothing to learn from who we are and attracts those who do, and from whom we have to learn, as well.' 'But that takes a lot of faith, and meanwhile you get pretty lonely.'. - Donald Shimoda:

"In later chapters, the Universe will seem different. The expansion of spacetime will make distant stars invisible, and the night skies will go dark. Perhaps life in the far future will wonder what it was like to live in the Universe's brilliant early days? We are lucky enough to know the answer. All we have to do is look up." - melodysheep:
"Allow yourself to look up into the night sky and see more than you did before. Do not feel small, insignificant, unimportant or pointless. Instead, thank you eyes, your brain, your body and your own silent companion throughout your life for allowing you consciousness at such an extraordinary time period where we can study these mysteries of existences that are so far away, and whatever you believe in don't allow this video or others to ever discourage that belief, whether it be god, science, aliens, the paranormal, or nothing. Instead, combine the knowledge we do know with your own beliefs and theories to see what depths of your own mind you can then explore. We too as human beings are made up of the same stuff as galaxies. Maybe we're not supposed to know. Maybe the true meaning of life, while you have it, is to simply give it some meaning." - The Top Tens:

"You got two voices in your head.. You got that voice that makes you feel like shit, and you got the voice that keeps you calm and happy. That happy voice is always going to be pointing you towards the path of comfort and least-resitance. But its that negative voice, that "sucky" voice, that is the one you need to listen to. Thats the one that is telling the truth. By forcing yourself to do the things you hate to do, so that you can better yourself and your life, is what brings self-respect. And a strong sense of self-respect, leads to a fulfilling life." - David Goggins:
"You're an interesting species. An interesting mix. You're capable of such beautiful dreams, and such horrible nightmares. You feel so lost, so cut off, so alone, only you're not. See, in all our searching, the only thing we've found that makes the emptiness bearable, is each other." - Alien from Contact:
"I'm not running away. But this is one corner in one country in one continent in one planet that's a corner of a galaxy that is a corner of a universe that is forever growing and shrinking and creating and destroying and never remaining the same for a single millisecond. And this is so much, SO MUCH, to see, Amy. Because it goes so fast. I'm not running away from things. I'm running to them before they flare and fade forever. That's all right.

"The pursuit of looking young accentuates the fear of growing old. So maybe if we embraced growing old, embraced our wrinkles and other people's wrinkles, maybe marketers would have less fear to work with and magnify." - Matt Haig:
"Set your mind to something, put in the work to get there, execute the plan." - Courtney Dauwalter:

"The first feature of the new engine is it’s greatly increased ratio compression, represented by r minus 1 over r to the power of gamma, alternating between 9 and the power of xy squared duplicated by 32 and 88 point recurring, reduced by 19 alpha providing equal cubes of epsilon in serial circumference, aligned by three double governor values flowing radially to the point of 3.65 pi... With concentric rows of blading and alternating with fixed rows on the diagrams. The longitudinal pressure exerted on the turbine shafts is counterbalanced by a grooved piston at the hp at the end of the shaft, with locates to the power of 900abh.7, and is seen in the end elevation of the true line of cylinders at an angle of 65 degrees. This device renders the engine, completely silent!" - Mr. Memory:
