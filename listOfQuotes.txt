"The first feature of the new engine is it’s greatly increased ratio compression, represented by r minus 1 over r to the power of gamma, alternating between 9 and the power of xy squared duplicated by 32 and 88 point recurring, reduced by 19 alpha providing equal cubes of epsilon in serial circumference, aligned by three double governor values flowing radially to the point of 3.65 pi... With concentric rows of blading and alternating with fixed rows on the diagrams. The longitudinal pressure exerted on the turbine shafts is counterbalanced by a grooved piston at the hp at the end of the shaft, with locates to the power of 900abh.7, and is seen in the end elevation of the true line of cylinders at an angle of 65 degrees. This device renders the engine, completely silent!" - Mr. Memory:
